A Physics Engine made with C++ and OpenGL. This project allows simulating basic physics. It enables users to easily apply physics principles.
You can use this SourceCodes to create simple games such as Flappy Bird. :)

OpenGL Libraries used: GLFW and GLEW; no other external libraries have been used.

Note: To achieve the intended results perfectly, the device's FPS should be locked at 144Hz using external tools like RivaTuner.
